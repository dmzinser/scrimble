## [scrimble]

# Description

"Scrimble" is a single-player, timed, word scrambling game themed to the Adult Swim original program "Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"  The game randomly selects a single word from an array of popular words used in the show, randomly scrambles the characters of that word and then displays the newly scrambled word (the "scrimble") to the player.  To advance, the player must key in the correct unscrambled version of the word within the allotted time.  If correct, the game randomly selects a new randomized word from the array and appends it to the display (removing the previous word from the array so that it cannot appear twice); the player is also awarded a single point.  If the player's input does not match the correct word, the "scrimble" will stay displayed until the correct word is entered or until the timer reaches zero.  The player wins the game by progressing through three rounds within the allotted timeframe.  Each round requires three correct answers for a total of nine correct responses.  If the player cannot win all three rounds within the specified timeframe, the game ends.
